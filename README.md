Hi I'm Karol. I am currently studying Computer Science on Aplen-Adria Universitaet in Klagenfurt (but it is just a semester abroad, my home uni is Poznan University of Technology).

I've been programin for couple yeras now, even though most of me works is purely academical. I did couple bigger projects for different subjects on universty.

One of my bigger interests is GameDev. I am a part of GameDev Student Association on PUT (RPG, check out on FB) and there, with my friend I worked on two bigger projects using unity: 2d rouglike with turn time strategy called **Project:Mercenary** (available on itch.io) and underwater labirynth escaping game in 3d called **DeepTwelve** (still in development, but should soon have a working demo).

My tech stack is quite diverse. I started programming in **C++** (honeslty I did my first code in Scrath and then in Lego Mindstorm NXT system, but that kinda doesn't count), and since then added a couple of other languages. I can write scripts in **Python** (plus I did ton of courses on different aspects, like NLP or ML, and also planing on going into _Django_ thanks to uni. Also I have I think three more projects somewhere, so maybe in the future they will apear here (games!)) and in **Java** (which currently is my main goal, I did recently two games in FX, and trying to catch up with some modern technologies -> _Spring_, etc).

I would consider myself as being a backend developer, because I really hate working with UI (though I had to work on it in games and in some project on Uni -> I used _QT_, because C++ is better than Delphi, and we had no other option).

I also did a course on data science with **R** (DataCamp), but that was more for fun and education than anything practical (honestly getting internship in DSc is nearly impossible).

So that's mostly it. If you want to know, in my free time I read a lot (comicbooks (Marvel is better) and fantasy books (but other genres also sometimes find a way to my bookshelf), I love traveling and mountain hikig (that's why I am in Austria right now), I do scale models (not collect them, mind you, mostly planes) and write (am a writer at heart, coding is also kinda writing, so bonus points here).

I also love to learn, and am quite good at it (fast and precise, so to say). I speak fluent English and Polish (hello, that's my native language, and I fully agree that it's crazy complicated language) and trying to get fluent in German (don't believe what you see on the internet, it's a beutiful language). 
So that's it, definetly this time.
