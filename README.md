Hi I'm Karol. I am currently studying Computer Science on Alpen-Adria Universitaet in Klagenfurt (but it is just one year abroad, my home uni is Poznan University of Technology).

I've been programing for couple yeras now, even though most of my works is purely academical. I did a couple of bigger projects for different subjects on universty.

One of my bigger interests is GameDev. I am a part of GameDev Student Association on PUT (RPG, check out on FB) and there, with my friend I worked on two bigger projects using unity: 2d rougelike on hexes with turn time strategy called **Project:Mercenary** (available on itch.io) and underwater labirynth escaping game in 3d called **DeepTwelve** (early demo is available as of now, there are still minor bugs and a lot of place for improvements, but majroity works). In December of 2022 I had the opportunity to participate in 6th Winter Jam at Uni Klagenfurt. There, along some awsome artists and programmers we developed a small game called **Possession**, platformer with main function of possessing npc in order to use their abilities. And although 48 hours have proven too little time to finish a working game, we managed to prepare mostly working prototype, which is now developed into early demo, with working mechanics but without balancing level and lacking UI.

My tech stack is quite diverse. I started programming in **C++** (honeslty I did my first code in Scrath and then in Lego Mindstorm NXT system, but that kinda doesn't count), and since then added a couple of other languages. Majority of my work is done in **Python**: both small scripts (for example those done on Advent of Code '21 and '22), bigger projects (NLP or ML, and also  _Django_) plus some "games" or just programs with UI done in _pygame_. Also I have I think three more projects somewhere, so maybe in the future they will apear here (true games!)). I also work in  **Java**: some games in _FX_, some smaller apps (mostly single-purpos things for recruitment tasks). I tried to do something with modern technologies (like _Spring_), but for now I only managed to finished some one or two courses. Also due to courses on Uni(s), I did a couple of android apps in **Kotlin** (mostly to learn the language, but also to explore some of the mobile devices features, like connecting to internet, using DBs, BlueTooth).

I would consider myself as being a backend developer, because I really hate working with UI (though I had to work on it in games and in some project on Uni -> I used _QT_, because C++ is better than Delphi, and we had no other option).

I also did a course on data science with **R** (DataCamp), but that was more for fun and self-education than anything practical (honestly getting internship in DSc is nearly impossible). I am familliar with couple of modern technologies, like **SQL** (alongside DML, I started with Oracle dialect, but can find my way around Postgres also), Docker (even though those skills are *very* basic) and Git (duh!). I also know like basic basics of working with console, can write some simple scripts for shell. I have a basic knowledge of computer construction and network configuration.

So that's mostly it. If you want to know, in my free time I read a lot (comicbooks (Marvel is better, but not nearly as good as Image and French comics) and fantasy books (but other genres also sometimes find a way to my bookshelf)), I love traveling and mountain hiking (that's why I am in Austria right now), I do scale models (not collect them, mind you, mostly planes) and write (am a writer at heart, coding is also kinda writing, so bonus points here). And love music, it helps a lot with coding.

I also love to learn, and am quite good at it (fast and precise, so to say). I speak fluent English and Polish (hello, that's my native language, and I fully agree that it's crazy complicated language) and trying to get fluent in German (don't believe what you see on the internet, it's a beutiful language). 
So that's it, definetly this time.
